### New pseudoinstructions

Problem: we would like a way to store 64 bit integers, but we only
have 32 bits to work with.

```
li reg, const # load 32 bit const into register
la reg, label # load 32bit address corresponding to the label into register
```

example of usage:

```MIPS
L1: li $t4, 0xABCD1234
    la $t6, L1
```

This allows us to store said integer, bypassing the afforementioned limitation.
