(@04example) Example:

x = a + b - c;

```pseudo-assembly
"add" t, a, b   #t <- a+b
"sub" x, t, c   #t <- (a+b) - c
```

First item is always destination in MIPS.

```pseudo-assembly
read MEM[a]              # 8 cycles
read MEM[b]              # 8 cycles
add above 2              # 1
store result at MEM[t]   # 8
read MEM[t]              # 8
read MEM[c]              # 8
sub ...                  # 1
store result at MEM[x]   # 8
//TOTAL of 50 Cycles
```

FSB

: Front Side Bus.


CPU operates at 3.2GHz, FSB operates at 400MHz, meaning one read of memory takes
8


Ways to improve this problem:

1. increase the speed of the FSB
   * the problem with this is that finite distance scale of the FSB limits speed improvements
2. Package things shorter
   * some advantages but FSB also has to attach to other items

3. create a cache of processor local RAM
   * not covered in this course.
   * programmer transparent, does not know whether something is in cache or not. CPU decides what is copied into the cache.
   * registers: these are a much smaller than the cache, for high priority variables. Programmer decided/controlled.

### Behold the MIPS

Conventions: Registers on MIPS (32 registers of 32 bits each)

  * general purpose registers

  * there are conventions for what these 'general' registers

| Instructions (MIPS) | Description       |
|---------------------|-------------------|
| `add   rd, rs, rt`  | `#rd <- rs + rt`  |
| `sub   rd, rs, tt`  | `#rd <- rs - rt`  |
| `addi  rt, rs, imm` | `#rt <- rs _ imm` |


Instructions

```MIPS
add   rd, rs, rt      #rd <- rs + rt
sub   rd, rs, tt      #rd <- rs - rt
addi  rt, rs, imm     #rt <- rs _ imm
```

Suppose you are going to write a MIPS program to execute the following C code:

```c
x=a + b - c + 5;
```

```MIPS
#allocate: a-> $30  b ->$s1 c->$s2  x->$s3
add   $t0, $s0, $s1   #$t0 <- a+b
sub   $st1, $t0, $s2  #$t1 <- a+b - c
addi  $s3, $t1, 5     #x <- a+b - c + 5 NOTE: USING 5 literally
```

RAM: Random Access Memory

![ram illustration](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/TFU0RE4N7-FFXV6150T/image.png?pub_secret=3bcfa7091b)

Memory instructions:

```pseudo-assembly
lw <destination>,<source>   #load word
sw <source>,<destination>   #store word
```
destination is a register (always)
source (imm (register) i.e the address you are storing is a immutable)

Example implement the following C code in MIPS

```c
x = arr[i] + y;
```

```MIPS
#Alloc: i -> $s0, y -> $s1 x -> $s2
#Alloc: arr -> $s3 # ibase address of arr`
add   $t1, $s0, $s0   # t1 <-2i
add   $t1, $t0, $t0   # t1 <-4i
add   $t1, $t1, $s3   # t1 <- addr. of arr[i]
lw    $t0, 0($t1)     # t0 <- arr[i] read data
add   $s2, $t0, $s1   # x  <- arr[i] +y
```
```c
x = arr[i+5] + y;
```

<!-- So you all know, you can see the assembly of programs on the website godbolt.org Choose MIPS 5.4 and write a C++ program, and make sure to enter -O3 in the compiler arguments. -->
